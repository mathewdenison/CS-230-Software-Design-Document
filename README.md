# CS-230-Software-Design-Document

- Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
        *The Gaming Room client is a small software company looking to expand the reach of their successful game       on the Android platform. They want to expand to other OS platforms to increase revenue.

- What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
           *My belief is that I addressed specific needs of Server Client relationship and how to implement this in a realistic fashion. This was addressed in the Design Constraints area of this document.

- What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
           *I felt that it gave a high level understand of how software design begins, as well as a reference point for developers to access a generic understanding of the design implementation. 

- If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
             *I'd like to specifically address design constraints related to OS and language integration on supported and unsupported OS. Due to the scope of the contract, there will be many issues with how to get developers writing code in supported languages on OS. I'd also like to research more on if there are simpler ways to host/write code that has more flexibility between platforms requested by the client.

- How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
          *I interpreted the users needs as given by the prompt and then had to do research as to what possible issues could arise. It is extremely important as this gives us leverage on our end as to what is feasible based on the given budget. It also forces us to get creative as to solutions to the clients request to provide a full scale solution.

- How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
          *To this point my first step has been to write pseudocode first without creating a design document. In the future I would implement this as a way to slow down the design process to implement the best practices for the client/prompt.
